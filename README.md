# SpendWise - JavaScript Foundation

## What your SpendWise project does
SpendWise is a simple budget tracking application that helps users manage their monthly income and expenses. It collects income and three expense items from the user, calculates total expenses and remaining balance, and warns if the user is overspending.

## The JavaScript concepts implemented
- Variables (let)
- Data Types (Number, String)
- User Input (prompt)
- Calculations (arithmetic operators)
- Functions (reusable functions)
- Conditional Logic (if/else)
- Console Output (console.log)
- DOM Manipulation (getElementById)

## How variables are being used
- `monthlyIncome`: Stores user's monthly income
- `expense1, expense2, expense3`: Store individual expense amounts
- `totalExpenses`: Stores sum of all expenses
- `remainingBalance`: Stores income minus expenses
- Variables use `let` and are parsed to float for calculations.

## How user input is collected
User input is collected through JavaScript `prompt()` dialogs. The app asks for monthly income and three expense names with their amounts. Inputs are converted from string to numbers using `parseFloat()` for accurate calculations.

## How calculations are performed
Calculations use arithmetic operators:
- Total Expenses = expense1 + expense2 + expense3
- Remaining Balance = monthlyIncome - totalExpenses
These are done inside the `calculateBudget()` function.

## How functions help organize the code
Functions separate concerns:
- `collectUserInput()` - Handles all input collection
- `calculateBudget()` - Handles only math logic
- `displayResults()` - Handles output to console and page
- `startBudgetApp()` - Main controller that calls other functions in order
This makes code reusable, readable, and easy to maintain.
